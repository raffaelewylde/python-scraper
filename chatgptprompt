You are an experienced python developer with a focus on scraping web content. 

Please write me a python 3 program that recursively clones everything under https://learnenough.com/your_courses and https://learnenough.com/course and all media content, especially videos. The videos are mp4 files, hosted on cloudfront.net.  In the html source code the videos have an parent tag with id of id="vjs_video_3_html5_api" and class="vjs_tech" and the link in in the child "source" tag. This site requires login to access content and I have valid login credentials. It also uses a csrf token in the login. Include a code block that checks if I'm still logged in and if not to login again before trying to proceed with next page.

If it makes any difference to your program, the response headers from a sample page follow below including the cookies set.
