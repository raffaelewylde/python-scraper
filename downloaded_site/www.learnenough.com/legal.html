School represents and warrants that School has the authority to provide consent for Learn Enough to collect information from students before allowing students under 13 to access our Service, and that School has provided appropriate disclosures to students and parents regarding School’s sharing of Student Data with service providers such as Learn Enough. We recommend that School provide a copy of our Privacy Policy to parents and guardians.</p>

<h2>Governing Law and Arbitration</h2>
<p>Governing Law. You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Learn Enough, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California.</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Los Angeles County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.</p>
<p>Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM LEARN ENOUGH. In the unlikely event that Learn Enough has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Learn Enough claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Service, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein.

Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Learn Enough from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Learn Enough’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND LEARN ENOUGH ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, .COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.</p>

<p>Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Learn Enough in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Learn Enough concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.</p>
<p>No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Learn Enough’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
Government Use Rights.

<h1>
Privacy Policy
<span>effective date: October 14, 2014</span>
</h1>
<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their personally identifiable information is being used by Softcover. This, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your information</p>
<p>When purchasing or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, email address or other details to help you with your experience.</p>
<p>We will never sell your private data or information. We don't give out your private info to organizations that may sell it. We do though disclose some customer information to SAAS providers that we use in order to make the Softcover service functional. Those third party companies include Google Mail for any communication with us, Circle CI for continuous integration testing, Heroku for hosting, Amazon S3 for storage—each of these has their own privacy policies.</p>
<h2>Your Content</h2>
<p>Softcover accesses your code through the open-source Softcover gem only if and when you decide to use the Softcover site to manage sales. Your content is never delivered to Softcover if you build your content but do not publish the files to Softcover. The Softcover service operates on a read only basis and does not write any information into your content, as the gem is open source you can see exactly what it does—once it is sent to Softcover we keep only your rendered files.</p>
<p>No human ever reads your code in the normal order of business operations, and we only have access to your code with your express permission and through your installing and configuring the Softcover gem.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p>All access to account information, payment information, and author sales data is conducted over SSL connection, and all passwords are 1-way encrypted, never plaintext. Softcover admins will never access your sensitive data unless you specifically authorize us to do so, and Softcover admins have no access to your password.</p>
<p>Transactions are processed through Stripe.com, a 3rd party payment processor, and all payment information is stored on Stripe. For authors, your sales revenue never passes through Softcover and is always stored only in your personal Stripe account. Royalties for use of the sales platform are taken out during the transaction so funds are never co-mingled. We cannot access any sales information stored on Stripe without your supplying us with a valid API key.</p>
<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>We use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart, to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity (which enables us to provide you with better services), and we also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.</p>
<p>We may also use trusted third party services that analyze this information on our behalf to better understand our customers.</p>
<p>If you disable cookies in your browser, some features will be disabled.</p>
<h2>Partners</h2>
<p>Softcover is built on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 through Heroku. If the EC2 service becomes vulnerable, your content may also become vulnerable to accidental disclosure. Amazon's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Security Center<!-- raw HTML omitted --> discusses their security in great detail.</p>
<h2>CalOPPA</h2>
<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.  The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
<p>According to CalOPPA, users can visit our site anonymously, and this privacy policy is always available in the footer of the website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy', and can be easily be found on the page specified above, and users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on the Privacy Policy page.</p>
<h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.  The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.</p>
<h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices, should a data breach occur we will notify the users via email within 7 business days.</p>
<h2>Feedback</h2>
<p>We take security incredibly seriously. If you have any suggestions for how we could improve our security, or improve this policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@softcover.io">info@softcover.io</a>. We will act immediately to deal with the issue.</p>
